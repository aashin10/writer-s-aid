# writer-s-aid
A basic website we created during freshman year to help writer's overcome writer's block by setting up a deadline and providing creative inputs.

Implementation:
Here a timer is set to based on the input by user. This timer is used to indacte the time user gets to think creatively and write about the generated random word. The random word is generated using an API fetch made to GEMINI AI. The writer is provided with writting space once they set a timer.

Directions to use:
Step 1: Clone the repository on to your local machine.

Step 2: Generate an API Key by logging in to Google AI studio.
        Link: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

Step 3: Paste you API Key to the API_KEY variable in code.

You are ready to go!
